`tent-rs` is a sanctuary for Rust crates that have lost their maintainers.

Our mission is to provide a temporary haven for these crates, ensuring they remain operational and up-to-date with the evolving Rust ecosystem.

## What We Do

The Rust ecosystem is vibrant and ever-evolving. However, sometimes maintainers move on, leaving crates without the necessary upkeep. `tent-rs` steps in to ensure these crates don't fall by the wayside, providing a temporary tent of support.


### Minimal Maintenance

We commit to providing the bare minimum maintenance required to keep these crates functional. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Fixing CI issues.
- Upgrading dependencies.
- Regular releases.
- Typos fixes.

### No New Features or Bug Fixes

We will not be adding new features or addressing bugs. Our focus is solely on ensuring the crates remain usable in their current state.

### Temporary Shelter

Our support is provisional. If the original maintainers return, we will gladly hand back the reins, ensuring they are updated with all the changes made. If a crate no longer has an active user base, we may decide to discontinue our support.

## How to use?

```toml
package = { package = "tent-package", version = "x.y.z" }
```
